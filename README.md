Quickeys - A chrome extension to control your Yamaha network receiver and HomeAssistant system.

A quick keyboard remote controller for your Yamaha receiver - now with HomeAssistant support.

To setup:
1. Install the extension
2. Config keyboard shortcuts (letters) and attach commands to them

To use:
1. Click the extension icon (or assign a keyboard shortcut from the Chrome extensions screen for an even quicker launch)
2. Type your command (e.g. hit the key P)
3. Watch your stereo gets powered up, volume changes or even HomeAssistant scripts being launched.


It's as simple as that.


Quickly written for personal use, and really liked it so decided to share.

A word for developers and contributors:
The system is built in a modular way.
In the js/modules folder you will find the initial currently written modules (for Yamaha and HomeAssistant).
You should be able to easily duplicate one of them and write your own module.

Please LMK if you're interested in adding something and we'll coordinate.

For any comments, feature requests or bug reports - please use GitHub's issues module (2nd tab at the top).

Thanks!
